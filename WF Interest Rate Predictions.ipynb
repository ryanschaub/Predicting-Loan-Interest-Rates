    "### Create Extreme Gradient Boosted Decision Tree Model using XGBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "Extreme gradient boosting is a Kaggle-popular machine learning technique that can be used on supervised learning problems like classification and regression problems. The model creates an ensemble of relatively weak prediction models or \"learners\" (usually decision trees, but linear models can be used as well). The weak learners (decision trees with, say, one or two logical conditions applied to samples of the data) are built sequentially and the output of each learner corresponds to the weight the algorithm gives to the outcomes in the subsequent learner, at least in classification; in regression, however, at each iteration, a new tree learns the gradients of the residuals between the target values and the current predicted values, and then the algorithm conducts gradient descent based on the learned gradients. That is, at each iteration, the learners are combined and start to predict the training data more accurately, becoming increasingly complex along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, each learner is applied a weight  and a combined model is built for final analysis/predicting.\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost is a specific implementation of gradient boosted decision trees designed for speed and performance. It is most known and used for its 'regularized boosting' technique, its fast, parallel processing in its decision tree building (leading to potential scalable production), and its relatively high customization options with hyperparameters.

    "### Ridge Regression Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first model I selected to predict interest rates was a ridge regression model using scikitlearn's RidgeCV() esitmator. Ridge regression is a multiple linear regression model, where multiple linear regression assumes that the target, numerical variable (interest rate) is a combined linear function of multiple numeric features. Ridge regression is advantageous to a base linear regression estimator in that it penalizes or regularizes (using the L2 norm) the model's coefficient values for specific features that correlate highly with other features or predictors, also known as multicolinearity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn's RidgeCV() object allows for the alpha parameter, or regularization strength parameter, to be optimized via cross-validation selection, where each of the alpha parameters given (I used the default parameter values) are tested on the training data and the alpha parameter that produces the highest accuracy scores will be stored in the model object for predictions. An advantage of using linear regression models is their relative ease of use, fast computation times, and straightforward deployment and maintenance in production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ridge Regression Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "The RidgeCV regression model (with 10-fold cv technique used to optimize alpha parameter) produced an RMSE of 0.0090 when predicting on the training data. This RMSE implies that the root average of the model's squared residual errors in prediction is roughly the equivalent of plus or minus 0.90 of the the true value of the interest rate, since the interest rate was scaled down during preprocessing (divided by 100). \n",
    "\n",
    "A potential improvement to the linear regression model would be to attempt to regress on the interest rate using an elastic net regularization model, which combines L2 and L1 norm regularization methods in order to optimize coefficient values of features in detecting the true, combined feature signal. This may not always be a better solution, but, in production, it may be worth verifying.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extreme Gradient Boosted Decision Tree Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed above, extreme gradient boosting is a very popular machine learning model being used ubiquitously in regression and classification problems, specifically in Kaggle-based competitions. The model's have proven to produce high performance measures as it uses a sequential series of \"weaker\" decision tree models to learn the data's signal using gradient descent on the loss function of each sub-model. The model then combines the accuracies of each model, using a weighted sum of predictions, to produce a best-fitting or highest-performing model. The speed of the models are valued as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "I specifically used XGBoost's python module xgboost as it provides relatively high customization options for hyperparameters and relatively fast processing with its built-in parellel processing when building decision trees. Many of the model's default parameters work well for this regression problem, but there were a few that I manually tuned via trial-and-error efforts. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **max_depth:** the max_depth of each decision tree built. This is used to control over-fitting of the training data as higher depths will fit to more noise in the training data. Final value used: 6\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **min_child_weight:** this is the sum of the weights defined for each child of each learner. This is used to also control overfitting of training data. (higher values == more regularization for each sample in a tree). Final value used: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **eta:** this is essentially the learning rate of the model or the alpha value when gradient descent occurs. This makes the model more robust by shrinking the weights on each step for gradient descent. Final value used: .1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **subsample:** the fraction of observations to be randomly sampled for each tree. Lower values make the algorithm more conservative and prevents overfitting but too small values might lead to under-fitting. Final value: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **colsample_bytree:** similar to subsample except it is the fraction of columns to be randomly sampled for each tree. Final value: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **num_boosting_rounds:** the number of iterations or trees built to produce the best accuracy measure when training the model and testing its accuracy on allocated test data. Final value: 441\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **early_stopping_rounds:** this threshold tells the model how many test accuracy scores to look back upon during training iterations. If the testing scores don't improve after 10 consecutive iterations, the model will stop and take the best score. Final value: 10\n",
    "\n",
    "The hyperparameters of the model were tuned in a less-than-optimal way in exchange for computational efforts; that is, I manually tuned each of the above hyperparameters with a bit of intuition and trial-and-error efforts (running the model with different values set and choosing the best performing parameter values). A much more optimal way of tuning the model's parameters would be to do a cross-validation search of the best combination of parameters, most likely including choices for other available, tunable parameters as well. However, in the interest of computational time (and our time), I manually tuned the model instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that I trained the XGB model on only 90% of the training data as the other 10% was randomly sampled from the training data and allocated as test data to optimize the general fit of the model during training. This helps ensure that overfitting doesn't occur on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extreme Gradient Boosting Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "The RMSE of the XGB model on the training data was roughly 0.0066. This is lower than the ridge regression model's RMSE, but does come at the cost of computational time for training and predicting. It would be interesting to see if the above-mentioned improvement suggestions would allow for an increase in performance that may be worth the extra computational time in production. Although both models were regularized and optimized to prevent overfitting as much as possible, I would expect the RMSE values on the test set predictions from both models to be slightly higher than their respective training set RMSE's as the models are naturally going to predict better on the data that they were trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection and Improvement Suggestions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Although they do outperform some models I've seen on Kaggle, I believe both of the models created can be improved for better performance, which would be ideal for production. The extreme gradient boosting decision tree model outperforms the regression model with an RMSE of 0.0066 compared to RidgeCV's 0.0090, but it does come at the cost of computational time and effort. Furthermore, I believe my preprocessing techniques were limited to my inuitive (and learned) understanding of features that may influence interest rates of loans. I removed quite a few columns from the data that may have been useful indicators. The above plot of F-scores for each feature used in predicting shows that loan subgrades are highly correlated with interest rates while the number of delinquencies and derogatory public records were the least important features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Upon reflection, I would have given every feature its chance in predicting interest rates and used a more empirical of statistical techniques in evaluating features for preprocessing, like using extreme gradient boosting F-scores to detect and display the most important features. From there I could potentially choose more important features and omit less important features, as well as engineer new features out of highly important features to create stronger signals. For example, I would look futher into the relationship between loan subgrades and interest rate by generating a scatter plot of the two variables to discern if there is a specific relationship between the two and alter the loan subgrade feature or create a new feature using this feature to model the relationship better when predicing."
